# Weather-Stream
Weather Overlay and alerts during stream.
I'm Geae Liska name pronounced just like the letter G

I'm a weather enthusiast and I would like to someday start streaming during national weather events.
I have a professional grade radar software that allows me to see storms throughout the whole United States.

What I would like to have done is during my streams with StreamLabsOBS or OBS allone is have weather alerts popup in my stream regardless of location. This alert would have a voice announcement with an animation. I thought using an API would work but I don't know how that works.

Not only that on the bottom portion of my stream I would like the active Severe Thunderstorm Warnings, Tornado Warnings, and Tornado Emergencies with the cities affected to flip between each other. 

I also would like on the top left of my stream to show the count for active tornado warnings.

Some of the other things like time and what not I will add on my own.

Thanks in advance
Geae
